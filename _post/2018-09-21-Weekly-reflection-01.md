An impression i had for this class was that i never knew that in computer science you did math, I only thought it was computing.In addtion I learned to create a new file and follow the steps it said espesifcally,another thing i learned was that i had to try things first before asking a teacher for help. A challenge i faced was when i had to read all the steps and create things i've never done before in a computer.

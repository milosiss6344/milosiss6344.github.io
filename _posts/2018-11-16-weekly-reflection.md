In this weeks learning something i learned was that programming is more than coding numbers and images. We learned that when you model something it uses drawing, programming and locations. Programming uses different types of data, there is also physical change. We also learned how to define expressions. When we define expressions we are writing the definition of the expression. For example ```(define shape 1 (triangle 50 "solid" "green"))``` this define a triangle with the size of 50 with the color green being solid.

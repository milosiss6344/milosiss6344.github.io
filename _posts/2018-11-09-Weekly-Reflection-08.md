In this weeks learning somethings i learned that a contract is a setup you write to get an image. I also learned to pay attention to place holders and defining expressions by summarizing the whole expression. In addtion we also learned that sqrt is a function. I also learned that an expression the variable can change and but not the names of the the expression. I also learned that when you are going to write an expression you first have to define it so the computer can recognize what you arre trying to get to  because sometimes you might think it that the computer is going to define but that doesn't actually happen all the time i also learned that value is not always a color sometimes the function is asking you to write a number instead of a color.

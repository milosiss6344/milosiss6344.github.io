In this week we had to choose a flag that we wanted to do and then we had to use colored papers to create it and glue it in a 8 by 11 piece of paper. The flag i choose was Norway. Norway has horizontally 6 units of red, 1 unit of white, 2 units of blue, 1 unit of white and 6 units of red. Verically the flag has 6 units of red, 1 unit of white. The official proportions of the flag are 16:22, being divided horizontally 6:1:2:1:12. A challenge i had was rying to divide the portion into smaller numbers so that the flag won't be that big in the 8 by 11 paper. Questions been asked this week by this project were:
# Do we put a picure of the flag in our blog post?
# How are we going to make the poertions of the flag smaller?
Something i would do differently to not faced the same challenge again is lsten carefully to my classmates questions and to what the teachers reponse to see so like that i won't have to probably face a challenge that we discussed in clas before going to computers.

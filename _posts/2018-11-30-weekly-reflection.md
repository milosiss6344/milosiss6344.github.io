In this week we had our midterm and some questions were hard to undestand and answer. The teacher graded it and gae it back to us and we wrote in what lever we where good at in the Mastery Skill. I picked question number 4. 70.4% of the students in version 1 choose letter a and 69.2% choose a in version 2. What the question is asking was to find the value of an expression which was (+(- 3 2) (+ 5 6)) and tyhe choises where:
(A) 12
(B) 17
(C) 10
(D) 11
the correct choice was (A), because 3-2 is 1 and 5+6 is 11 then add 1 to your answer which makes it 12.The next most chosen answer was (C) because they thought you had to subtract one instad of adding one.

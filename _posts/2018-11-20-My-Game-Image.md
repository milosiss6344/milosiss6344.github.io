![My Game Image](/images/download.png.png)

As you can see this is My Game Image that ive been talking about in the past weekly reflections you might be wondering how on earth did i do that well you first you have to create a new file called images/placeholders. Then afterwards you go to the website WeScheme and double click on your screenshot and download it to your computer name it something easy like download.png aftrwards save it. Go back to this page and go to the image file and upload the picture to the file you created where the picture is going to go and last but not least create a new post and write it in that form ^^ and talk about it.

Something new i learned this week in Computer Science is that for you to create a game you need coordinates! For exmaple when we where playing the Ninja game the dog changed it's x-coordinates everytime you would pass the level. Another thing i learned from this weeks lessons's was that a repository is a container that holds up a project. Something i can tell a person who is new at this things is that the default home age is index.html.

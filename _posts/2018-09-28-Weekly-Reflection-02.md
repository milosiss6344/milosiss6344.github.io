Something new i learned this week in Computer Science is that for you to create a game you need coordinates! For exmaple when we where playing the Ninja game the dog changed it's x-coordinates everytime you would pass the level. Another thing i learned from this weeks lessons's was that a repository is a container that holds up a project. Something i can tell a person who is new at this things is that the default home page is index.html. In addition something else i learned from this week was that we played a video game where we oberserved an recorded the changes happenning, Some of us finished our blogs/putting up our websites. Today Friday, September 28 2018 we started programming in this website called "WeScheme". A little fact when using this webiste "WeScheme" is that to use a function, you  open a parenthesis and put the function first(Adding,Subtracting,Multiplying, and Dividing) then the numbers you want the computer to solve. When you look up the website is going to look confuisng and you'll see like a page with two sides, the Right side is the Interactions Area(scrop) and the left side is the Definition Area(Keep).

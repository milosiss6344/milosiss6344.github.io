This weeks reflection is different from the other ones this is because this is a special reflection where is going to be graded as a college ready grade. In week one we learned how tor create new files in github.com and follow the the specific steps that the teacher told us to follow. A challenged i faced in that week learnings was that i had to create things in a website i've never seen before and done nothing about this before. In my second week somethings i learned were that in order for you to create a new game you need coordinates.

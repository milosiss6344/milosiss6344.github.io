In this weeks learning some connections i made was that when we where doing problems in math class about domain and range we where also written expressions which had domain and range in them. Another connection i can make between this class and math class is that we were writing expretions down in the form y+mx+b and in computer science we where writing expression down in that form but the only difference was that in computer scince we couldn't solve them. Some artifacts i did where changing the "Hank Quilian" names in my website to my name. Another artifact that i did was chaging the url's in the game creation to bitmap/url and putting whatever backgroung and character i wanted. Something i learned in this weeks lessons was that in order to have a contract you need to have two strings and a number in order for you to create the image you want. Another thing i learned was that a contract has a domain and range. The domain is the the number and the strings in the expression and the range is the the omage you get out of the expression.
